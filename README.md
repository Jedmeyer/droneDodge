Hello! Thank you for being interested in this project!
This is an integration attempt of the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 with the Open CV Libarary.
(On ubuntu 16.04 LTS)

As such, there are numerous requirements for being run it for yourself.
Most importantly, OpenCV (currently 3.4.0) available at: https://opencv.org/ 
Comprises most of the framework for this project. Its requirements are also
required for the program to operate. 
The realtime drone commands are integrated (or plan to be rather)
using the Parrot AR 2.0.1 SDK for the aforementioned drone.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!
